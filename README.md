## Description

A simple web app that acts as a 'backend' for a form. Acts as an end point for
the form. 

Simply point the ```action``` of your form to:

```<form action="http://custos.swm.cc/SOMEKEY" method="POST">```

The data will then go through several spam detection tools and if all is good
your data is sent back to you.

## Premise 

I am going to be house sitting for my parents the next few weeks. This is one
of the personal projects I've decided to give a go during that period.

Feel free to follow the [issues](https://github.com/swmcc/custos/issues) to see
what is going to happen and what has happened. 

## Should I use this?

I highly recommend using [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com). This is mainly a
hobby project for myself. If you want to use it feel free but it requires some
configuration.

## Development Info
